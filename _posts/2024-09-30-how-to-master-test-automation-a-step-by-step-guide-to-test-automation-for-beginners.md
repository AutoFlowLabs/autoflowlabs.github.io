<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

# **Standout benefits of test automation techniques**

<!--EndFragment-->

![](/assets/img/uploads/whatsapp-image-2024-09-24-at-15.20.15_960f20ea.jpg "Benefits of test automation")

<!--StartFragment-->

The advantages of test automation are not limited to higher speed and better efficiency in testing procedures. This technology also offers various other benefits to the software development teams, such as:

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Cost savings in the long run**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Higher initial costs are a significant factor preventing organizations from adopting test automation. Additional staffing requirements, time constraints, and maintenance overheads are prerequisites for a successful automation test suite, and these prerequisites may prevent organizational management from adopting this testing technique. 

However, the capital spent upfront is eventually recoverable by the cost savings that leaner and more effective software development offers. Upon completion of the setup, a team can use it repetitively at a fraction of the cost of a group of human testers. Organizations can save money by fixing errors faster and early in the software development life cycle. 

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Faster feedback loop**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Test automation via all modern-day frameworks drastically accelerates test case execution. They help machines work faster, specifically for repetitive tasks such as regression testing and integration. QA teams can obtain feedback sooner, which aids in faster bug detection and better functionality. 

Faster feedback loops offer an agility boost to test automation life cycles and help developers seamlessly integrate push code, receive feedback, and revise the code. Automation allows tests to execute faster to get accurate outputs in shorter sprints while facilitating flawless feedback. 

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Efficient resource allocation**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

With automation dealing with repetitive processes, QA personnel can shift their attention to activities that require judgment and cognitive engagement. Examples of these activities could be formulating new test cases, determining advanced testing metrics, examining test results minutely, etc. Test automation reduces the monotony of testing tasks and enables testers to be more productive in day-to-day roles. 

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Enhanced complex test scenario coverage**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Embracing the power of automation helps QAs execute a larger number of test cases to ascertain the maximum coverage of features and requirements in every test cycle. A broader test coverage raises the possibility of detecting bugs that fend off avoidable issues to go into production.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Rapid bug detection**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

With the advantage of test automation, developers can run unit tests before pushing code to version control and follow up with other test types. As every line of code gets tested extensively, earlier bug detection becomes possible. Faster and earlier bug detection opens the door for rapid and easier debugging.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Test at scale**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Regardless of the size and efficiency of your QA team, it simply can’t match the accuracy, speed, and range of an automation framework. For context, automation can help you simulate the activity of a thousand users on a site for load testing. Unless a QA team consists of more than a thousand members who are willing to browse a website simultaneously, manual testing can’t achieve it. Test automation supports parallel testing, which enables you to execute multiple tests simultaneously, helping you test at scale and speed. 

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Maximize RoI**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Test automation lets you accelerate product release without compromising the software build quality. It helps you achieve lower time-to-market and boosts your business's Return on Investment(RoI). 

The merits of test automation bring many benefits for enterprises that consistently look to build and deliver fresh products. Faster testing cycles, better accuracy, lower costs, and enhanced teamwork give QA teams a competitive advantage. Let’s look at the best practices to help you leverage the true scope of test automation for your organization.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

# **Best practices in test automation**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Test automation helps ensure optimal software operation and performance while offering an error-free user experience across platforms and devices. It also imparts extended coverage and precise outcomes that improve long-term product quality. However, to make test automation successful, you must familiarize yourself with the right tools, technical expertise, and test automation frameworks. Following a set of best practices can help you better execute automated tests while managing your resources effectively. Let’s explore the best practices in test automation that you must plan to implement.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Decide the test cases to automate**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Determine the test cases that should be automated first, as it's pretty impractical and unnecessary to automate all the cases. Devise a test automation plan by deciding which tests will excel from being automated. To ensure the best results, automate:

* Repetitive tests that run for several builds
* Tests that are prone to human error
* Tests that require multiple data sets
* Test that are impossible to execute manually
* Test that runs on various configurations, software platforms, and hardware

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Divide tasks based on skillset**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Assign each case to particular individuals based on technical prowess while creating test suites and cases. This allocation will enable team members with different skill levels to draft test scripts with considerably minimal ease. A few complications may arise if the team chooses to use open-source tools, as designing the tests requires someone capable of coding with that specific tool.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Establish collective ownership of tests**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Delegating a sole tester or engineer to carry out full-fledged automation testing projects defeats the purpose of qualitative testing. Ensure the entire team is looped in to enable meaningful contributions to better integrate automation into the testing infrastructure. This will help members familiarize themselves with the process and make timely decisions about conducting suitable tests. 

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Eliminate scopes of uncertainty**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Every additional false positive and inconsistency increases the time needed to scrutinize errors. To avoid this loss of time, you must remove uncertainties by extracting unstable tests in regression packs. Plan your testing adequately to ensure you don’t miss out on inspecting vital verifications, as they are common occurrences in automation tests. Additionally, ensure that the validity of test automation is thoroughly assessed throughout the test cycles.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Select the right test tool or framework**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

A suitable test automation tool can make your testing experience effortless. Consider the following points to choose the tool that best suits your needs.

* Check if the testing tool extends support for your platforms and technology.
* Confirm if the tool provides a higher level of flexibility for testers of varying skill levels. 
* Verify if the test tool can seamlessly integrate with your enterprise’s existing ecosystem.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Test on actual devices**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Ensure to conduct your tests on real devices or browsers, as the product needs to work appropriately on cross-platform multiple device-browser-OS combinations. A simulator or emulator can’t replicate real user interactions. Testing on actual devices helps evaluate if the product can work in real-world scenarios such as weak network strength, incoming calls, lower battery, etc.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## **Maintain records for better debugging**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Keeping records of failure scenarios in text or video log formats can help testers determine the reasons behind test failures. Selecting a tool with built-in support for automatically recording browser screenshots for each step is ideal for easily detecting errors in every step.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

## Employ data-driven tests 

The massive volume of data and the number of variables make it ambiguous for humans to conduct fast and accurate tests. Utilizing data-driven automation tests reduces the task to a single test and data set, which testers can use to work through an array of parameters and simplify the process. 

## Conduct tests frequently

Frequently running tests can help testers identify bugs as they appear and debug them immediately. It helps save time and valuable resources that could skyrocket if bug detection happens at later development and production stages.  

## Prioritize quality test reporting

Set up a robust test reporting infrastructure with the appropriate tools to generate elaborate, high-quality reports for every test. A good practice is to group tests according to parameters such as results, type, tag functionality, etc. 

The right tools can help you maximize the advantages of test automation in terms of coverage, efficiency, and accuracy while supporting continuous integration for repetitive tasks. These tools allow you to extract the best out of your test automation procedures while adhering to all the best practices in automation.
